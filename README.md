# BrainEnTech---dataset-1---funny-vs-boring-videos
This EEG dataset is created with the intention of classifying funny vs boring videos over approx 30 minutes. A subject is shown 5 minutes of a boring video followed by another 5 minutes of a funny video. This process persisted over 3 cycles. Brain EEG is aggregated over each second and their corresponding video classes are noted.
